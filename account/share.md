SGit Newsroom · a newsroom designed for you

# Send us your reading, get a front page designed for you

Use the site as you normally would for a few days. Then send us what you read: which pages, how far down each one, what you kept, put out of a persona or declined to pay for. In return, Dinis will reply with what your front page could look like, built from your actual reading. It is the fastest way for us to learn what a personal newsroom should be, and you get the first one.

1. **Read.** Open whatever interests you, scroll as far as it deserves, keep what is worth keeping. [Your newsroom](newsroom.md) shows what the site has learned so far.
2. **Look.** Below is exactly what would be sent, word for word. Nothing else leaves your browser.
3. **Send or copy.** Send it with your name and email, encrypted in this browser so that only our list agent can read it, or copy it and paste it into an email or a message to us.

Sharing needs JavaScript: your reading is kept in your browser, and only your browser can put it together.

## Where it goes

Into the same encrypted, write-only inbox the [newsletter](../subscribe/index.md) uses. Your browser encrypts it to the public key published in [/.well-known/sgit-subscribe.json](../.well-known/sgit-subscribe.json) and drops the ciphertext into a lane that can be written to but not read with anything on this site. The agent that holds the key files it as a reading share, separately from subscriptions, and it is used for one thing: to design your front page and reply to you. [How the inbox works](../docs/briefs/subscribe-lane-agent-brief.md#reading-share). Sending it does not subscribe you to the newsletter unless you tick that box.
