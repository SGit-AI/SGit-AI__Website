# The passkey opens the vault: a top vault computed from a passkey, vaults all the way down, and no server of ours

By [Dinis Cruz](../about/index.md) · 2026-10-11 · updated 2026-10-11 · [article v1.3.0, 4 versions](versions/the-passkey-opens-the-vault.md) · [site v0.7.62](../admin/versions.md) · passkeyswebauthnprfvaultskey-managementpkiclient-sidenewsroomarchitecturebriefsecretsarticle

***Abstract:** The missing piece of the client-side puzzle is a user who can open their own vaults on any device, in a few seconds, with nothing to remember and nothing to sign up for. This is the design, revised after a review of its first version. A passkey, through the WebAuthn PRF extension, gives the browser 32 bytes that only your authenticator can produce for this site, and from those bytes the browser computes the key and the id of your top vault. The top vault is the root of a chain we already use everywhere, vaults that hold the keys of other vaults: it holds the keys of your reading vault and your notes vault, the read keys you have been given, your access key, and your key pairs for this site, which are generated at random and never derived from the passkey, because the passkey is a lock, not an identity. The question I could not answer, where the top key is stored, has the answer nowhere: it is computed, and the only stored secret is the one inside the passkey, kept by whichever store you were already signed in to, Google, Apple or Microsoft, which is why the vault travels wherever that store does. Several passkeys give several tops, an admin and a reader, with the provider's own picker as the switch; a key moves between tops by copying, and a top is retired by deleting its vault, after which the passkey opens nothing. The first part is the design and the brief for the MVP on newsroom.sgit.ai; the second is what it enables for every other site we run.*

The key chain. The passkey's PRF output computes the top vault's key and id; the top holds the keys of the vaults below it and the person's key pairs; the vaults below hold the data. Nothing secret is stored anywhere to be fetched, and the vault server sees ciphertext at every step.

This is the missing piece of the puzzle. In [I miss it, so it is working](../articles/i-miss-it.md) I described the feature I miss: the newsroom on every device, in sync, through my own encrypted vault. In [No server, by design](../articles/no-server-by-design.md) I listed identity as one of the last things that still seemed to need a server. This article joins the two, in detail. It is the second version: the first had a vault too many in the chain and a sign-in that was not needed, and a review took both out. What changed is listed at the end.

The experience I want is simple. I open newsroom.sgit.ai in a new browser. I am asked to touch my passkey. And my reading account opens, the same as on every other device, because it is now in a vault only I can open. Two steps, one of them a gesture, no server of ours anywhere, and nothing to sign up for.

I had one question I could not answer: where is the top vault key kept? The answer, after the research, is that it is not kept anywhere. It is computed. The rest of this article is why that works, the design end to end, and what it makes possible for every other site we run.

## In short

- **You are already signed in, somewhere else.** On a Mac you are signed in to Apple, in Chrome to Google, on Windows to Microsoft, and that is where your passkeys live. The site does not need you to sign in to it. It asks the passkey store you already use, and the vault goes wherever that store goes.
- **The passkey is what opens the vault.** With the WebAuthn PRF extension, a passkey returns 32 bytes that only your authenticator can produce, for this site, and the same bytes on every device the passkey syncs to.
- **Where is the top key stored? Nowhere.** sgit vault keys are made in the client, a passphrase and a vault id. So the browser computes the top vault's key and id from the PRF bytes, opens it, and finds every other key inside. No chicken and egg, no new storage, only vault APIs.
- **The top vault is a keyring, and the pattern is one we already use.** Vaults that hold the keys of other vaults, all the way down. The top holds the keys of your reading vault and your notes vault, the read keys you have been given, your access key, and your key pairs for this site.
- **The passkey is a lock, not an identity.** The key pairs are generated at random and stored in the top, never derived from the passkey. Change the lock and the identity is untouched.
- **Several passkeys, several tops.** An admin passkey on a hardware key and a reader passkey in the cloud open two different tops, chosen in the provider's own picker. Keys move between tops by copying; a top is retired by deleting its vault, after which its passkey opens nothing.
- **Recovery is the top key itself**, shown once and saved in a password manager. Lose the passkey and the saved key, and no one, including us, can open the vaults.
- **Support is good enough to build on, and where the passkey lives decides what the reader gets.** PRF works in Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain, Windows Hello and Firefox. A synced provider or a hardware key gives the same newsroom on every device; a clean browser with neither gives one device, and Chrome's own store returns no PRF bytes at all, so the page checks at creation and offers a ladder of alternatives.
- **One rule the design depends on:** the whole origin loads no third-party scripts, on any page, because browser storage is per origin and a script on one page can read what another page kept. The vault code is vendored into the reader repository, not loaded from anywhere else.
- **It is not just for the newsroom.** Every site we build needs the same thing: an account with no server, data nobody else can read, on every device. This is that, as a pattern.

## Part one: the design

### What each piece actually gives you

It helps to separate the pieces, because they are easy to blur.

| Piece | What it gives the page | What it does not give |
|---|---|---|
| **The account you are already signed in to** (Apple, Google, Microsoft) | Nothing, directly. It is what syncs your passkey store between your devices, so the passkey you make on one device is on the others | Anything to the site: not your name, not your email, not that you have an account |
| **A passkey for this site** | A gesture (touch, face, PIN), a signature, and with PRF, 32 bytes computed from a secret the authenticator keeps for this site and this passkey | The bytes to anyone but the page on this site that asked, after the gesture |
| **The passkey store** | Where the passkey lives: Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain, Windows Hello, a hardware key, or the browser's own profile | Anything about what the bytes are for |
| **sgit** | Vault keys made in the client (a 24-character passphrase and an 8-character vault id), read and write keys derived from them, ciphertext on the server, and a way to delete a vault | A way to find a vault you have no key for |
| **The access key** | The right to create vaults and write to them on the vault server, the thing people will buy | Any way to read a vault |

One clarification that matters. What people call "the Google passkey" is a passkey **for this site**, registered by this page under this site's name, which your store keeps and syncs: Google Password Manager if you use Chrome, iCloud Keychain on Apple devices. It is not the passkey you use to sign in to Google, and a website cannot get PRF bytes from that one. There is no sign-in to the site at all: the page registers a discoverable credential with a user handle it chose, and the only login involved is the one you already have with your platform, which syncs the store. The site learns a credential id, a public key and, after your gesture, 32 bytes. Not your email, not your name, not which account syncs it.

That is also why the vault travels. If you are signed in to Apple on your iPhone, your iPad and your Mac, the passkey you make on one is on the others, and so is the vault it opens. If you make it in a clean browser with no store signed in, it stays on that device, which also works, for that device. The choice of store is the choice of where the vault goes, and the reader made it long before they met this site.

### Where the top key lives: nowhere

The places the key could live, and how you would find each before you could open it. Deriving the top vault from the passkey needs nothing to be found; the stored options become backups.

Every option for storing an encrypted vault key has the same problem: you have to find the encrypted key before you can open it, so it has to live somewhere you can reach with only what you have at that moment, which is your passkey.

- **Inside the vault itself:** you need the key to read the vault. The chicken and the egg.
- **An SG/Send transfer:** if the transfer id is assigned on upload, you need to have stored the id somewhere first.
- **A cloud folder in the user's own account**, such as Google Drive's app-data folder: it works from the browser, with the user present for each token, and it needs a sign-in to that account, which this design does not have. If it is ever used, it is an availability backup of an encrypted copy, not the main path.
- **A bucket keyed by the account id:** the design [secrets.sgit.ai](https://secrets.sgit.ai/) has, with Identity Platform and Cloud Storage. It works, and it is a cloud project per environment.
- **Inside the passkey (`largeBlob`):** support is too uneven to depend on.

And then the option that needs none of it. **sgit vault keys are generated in the client**: a random passphrase and a random vault id, and `sgit init` accepts a key it is given. So instead of generating the top vault's key at random and storing it, the browser **computes** it from the PRF bytes: the passphrase, and the vault id, with HKDF. On any device where the passkey is available, the same gesture gives the same bytes, the same id and the same key. The browser knows where to look and how to open it before it has fetched anything.

In the first version of this design, the computed vault was a "door" that held the key of a separate master vault. The review asked where the requirement for that extra step was, and in our case it is not there. The computed vault is the top of the chain. What it holds is the keyring.

### The derivation

For the newsroom MVP, with the relying party ID `newsroom.sgit.ai`:

1. **The PRF input** is a fixed, public value: `SHA-256("newsroom.sgit.ai/top/v1")`. An input is not a secret; only the authenticator can turn it into the 32 bytes.
2. **The seed** is `HKDF-SHA256(ikm = PRF bytes, salt = SHA-256("newsroom.sgit.ai"), info = "sgit/top/v1")`.
3. **The passphrase and the vault id** are two more HKDF outputs from the seed. sgit accepts any printable ASCII passphrase up to 256 characters, so the passphrase is the hex of 32 bytes (`info = ".../passphrase"`), keeping all 256 bits. The vault id has to be lowercase letters and digits, 4 to 24 of them, so 8 characters are drawn from a third output (`info = ".../id"`) with rejection sampling, so that no character is favoured.
4. **The top vault key** is the sgit vault key made of those two, and from there, sgit's own derivation gives the read and write keys, exactly as the command line does: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at 600,000 iterations, once for the read key and once for the write key. That is the cost of this design. The top and the reading vault need up to four derivations; measured in headless Chromium on a four-core machine, one takes about 105 ms and six run together about 640 ms, and a phone is several times slower, so a cold unlock can spend a second or two deriving keys before it fetches anything. The brief measures it on a phone, derives each vault's keys once per session, runs them in a worker, and derives a write key only when there is something to write.
5. **A second compartment from the same passkey** is the same derivation with a different input, say `.../top/persona/v1`. Two inputs give two unrelated outputs and two tops. That separates what is in memory at once; it does not separate authority, because whoever can use the passkey gets both. Authority is separated by a second passkey, below.
6. **Collisions** are not a practical worry with 36⁸ possible ids, but the page checks: a derived id that already holds something it cannot open is skipped, with a counter in the HKDF info.

The browser and the command line must agree byte for byte, so the brief includes test vectors: the same inputs through the browser code and through sgit in Python, with the same keys out.

### What is in the top vault

The top is a keyring: one small file of named entries, rarely written, and nothing else. The pattern is the one we already use everywhere, vaults that hold the keys of other vaults, so the only new thing here is where the top key comes from.

- **The keys of the vaults below it,** by site and purpose: the reading vault first, then the notes-to-the-agent vault, then whatever an agent creates for the reader. Each is an ordinary vault with its own random key, so a read key to one of them can be handed to an agent or a person without exposing anything above it. Depth is the blast radius control.
- **Read keys the reader has been given**, to vaults that belong to someone else.
- **The access key.** A read-only clone needs no token, so after the unlock the browser reads the top with nothing but the derived read key, and finds the access key inside. The reader pastes it once, on the first device; every other device gets it from the top.
- **The key pairs for this site.** At least a signing pair and an encryption pair, as [RFC 0001](../articles/rfc-0001-public-key-cryptography-for-sgit.md) separates them, and plausibly one per persona, so that what the CISO persona signs is not linkable to what the personal one signs. Each entry has a label, a purpose, a created date and a status. The public halves are published wherever the newsroom and the agent need them.

The key pairs are generated at random and stored. They are never derived from the passkey, and this is a decision, not an omission. A derived key pair cannot be rotated without changing the passkey, and you want several of them. More important, the passkey is a lock, not an identity: it opens the top and does nothing else. Everything that represents the person survives any change of lock, a new passkey, a second one, a hardware key, a recovery, a derivation bump. Rotate a lock and the identity is untouched; rotate an identity and the locks do not care. The trade-off against a non-extractable Web Crypto key is real and worth stating: a non-extractable key is stronger on one device, but it is one device, and an identity that has to be the same on the phone, the iPad and the iMac has to travel. An encrypted vault that only the passkey opens is the right vehicle for it. The private keys exist in browser memory only while the top is open.

Below the top, **the reading vault** holds one log per device, appended, never edited: pages read and how far, ratings, personas, the reading list, notes, receipts by payment reference. Every device computes the same state from all the logs, as described in [I miss it](../articles/i-miss-it.md).

### Several passkeys, several tops

A site can hold any number of passkeys for one person. Each passkey has its own PRF secret, so each computes its own top, and two passkeys are two independent trees. The facts that make this work, and the one that trips people up:

- **The store dedupes by user handle.** When a passkey is created, the site gives it a user id and a display name. iCloud Keychain and Google Password Manager treat a new passkey with the same user id for the same site as a replacement for the old one. So two passkeys that must coexist get two user ids and two names, "Dinis · admin" and "Dinis · reader". That is the whole trick.
- **The picker is the switch.** When the page asks for an assertion without naming a credential, the store shows its own sheet listing the passkeys it holds for this site, and the person picks one. That sheet is the interface for choosing which top to open; we do not build it. If the page remembers a credential id and a label in local storage, which are not secret, it can offer "Unlock admin" and ask for that passkey by id, with the sheet as the fallback.
- **Two stores in one browser.** In Chrome on a Mac the sheet offers both iCloud Keychain and Google Password Manager, plus a phone by QR and a hardware key, so one person can have a reader passkey in one store and an admin passkey in the other and switch between them on the same site in the same browser. Safari offers iCloud Keychain, hardware keys and a phone, not Google's store. Which of those paths returns PRF bytes in which browser is the thing the brief tests on a real machine rather than takes from a table.

The scenario this is for is separation of authority. An admin top holds what the desk needs: access keys, the write side of the newsroom's vaults, the publishing key pair. A reader top holds the reading vault, the notes vault and the persona key pairs. The admin passkey lives on a hardware key in a drawer, or in a different store from the reader one, so that the keys that can publish are not available every time the keys that can read are. The page shows which top is open, with a lock button that clears memory, and opens one top per tab by default.

**Moving keys between tops.** A top is a small file of entries, so a move is: unlock A, copy the entry into B, delete it from A. The catch is history. Vaults keep their versions, so an entry deleted from A is still in A's past for anyone who can open A. The rule: keys that move for security reasons get rotated, which for a vault key means `sgit rekey`, a new vault with a new id and the content re-pushed, and the references in every top updated; keys that move for tidiness do not; and a top being deleted takes its history with it.

**Retiring a top.** sgit can delete a vault from the server, `sgit vault delete-on-remote`, which needs the write key and a typed confirmation, and the vault's own files are gone. So the order is: move or rotate what the top held; delete the top's vault with its write key; delete the saved copy of its key from the password manager; then delete the passkey in the store's own settings, because a site cannot delete a passkey, only the person can. The coupling runs both ways and is worth noticing. Once the vault is deleted, the passkey still computes the same key, and the key opens nothing: a passkey whose vault is gone is inert. And once the passkey is deleted, the vault's ciphertext, if any survived, has no key. Deleting either side retires the pair. That is another reason to compute the top from the passkey rather than store its key: the lifecycle of the key is the lifecycle of the vault.

**Changing the derivation** is the same operation as adding a passkey: a new input gives a new top from the same passkey, the entries are copied across, the old top is retired. Nothing below the top moves.

### The flows

The first run, a new device, and a second passkey, a move and a retirement. Every step runs in the browser, against the user's passkey store for the gesture, and the vault server for ciphertext.

**First run.** Create a passkey for the site with `prf` enabled, named for its role; if the authenticator cannot do PRF, the page says which kinds can and offers another. Touch it: the PRF bytes give the top. Paste the access key. Generate the reading vault's key and the key pairs. Create the top and the reading vault. Move the reading account from the browser's storage into the reading vault. Show the top vault key once, behind "I have saved it in my password manager".

**A new device.** Touch the passkey, synced to this device or used from a phone by QR. The PRF bytes give the same top, the top gives the reading vault. Reading needs no access key; the access key comes out of the top, so this device can write as well. Merge this browser's reading into its own log.

**A second passkey.** Create it with a different user handle and name, in another store or on a hardware key. It computes its own top. Copy into it the entries it should hold, and nothing else.

**Lost a passkey.** Paste the saved top vault key; the top opens; create a new passkey, which computes a new top; copy the entries across; retire the old top in the order above.

**Signing out and locking.** Keys exist only in the page's memory: cleared on lock, after a period of inactivity, and when the page is closed. The browser's own copy of the reading account stays as it is today.

### Security, said plainly

- **What each party sees.** The vault server: ciphertext, sizes, times and ids that look random. Your platform account: that a passkey exists for this site, under the name you gave it, and a secret it never sees used. Not which key pairs exist, not what they signed, not which personas they belong to. Only this page, in your browser, after your gesture, holds the PRF bytes and the keys.
- **Whoever can use the passkey can reach everything below its top.** That is exactly the passkey's protection, the biometric, the device and the store, and nothing in our stack adds to it or weakens it. A second passkey for the admin top is how the reach is split.
- **The origin loads no third-party scripts, on any page.** Storage is per origin, so a script on any page of the site could read what the account page keeps. The newsroom's pages load only code from the reader repository, with the vault code vendored into it rather than loaded from the vault web app or tools.sgraph.ai.
- **The relying party ID is a trust boundary.** A passkey for `sgit.ai` would work on every `*.sgit.ai` site, and any of those sites could ask it for PRF bytes, so every one of them would have to be as strict as the strictest. The MVP uses `newsroom.sgit.ai` exactly, as secrets.sgit.ai uses its own host. Sharing across sites is part two.
- **Passkeys cannot be phished across sites.** They are bound to the site's name; a look-alike domain gets nothing.
- **Losing everything is final.** Every passkey and the saved key gone means no one can open the vaults. That is the property that makes the design worth having, and the first run says so before it shows the key.
- **Availability is not secrecy.** The vault server could delete or roll back ciphertext. It cannot read it. The local copy covers the first; nothing is needed for the second.
- **Agents do not have passkeys.** An agent that should read part of a user's data gets a read key for one vault, given by the user from the top, never the top itself.

### Where PRF works today

As of October 2026, from vendor documentation and published tests (see the sources):

| Passkey provider | PRF |
|---|---|
| Google Password Manager (Chrome, Edge and Samsung Internet; Android) | Yes, by default; desktop Chrome from version 136 |
| iCloud Keychain (Safari 18, macOS 15) | Yes |
| Windows Hello | Yes, since the February 2026 update to Windows 11 |
| Firefox | Yes, on macOS from version 139 and Windows from version 148 |
| Hardware security keys | Yes through `hmac-secret`, but not with YubiKeys in Safari |
| Chrome's own profile authenticator | No |

The page checks `prf.enabled` when it creates the passkey, and never guesses: if it is false, it says so and offers another authenticator.

### What happens in a clean browser

The table above is about browsers. The question that matters to a reader is about devices: will the newsroom I opened on my laptop be the same one on my phone? That depends on where the passkey lives, which is a choice the reader made long before they met this site, usually without noticing.

Where a passkey can live, what each place needs, whether the passkey travels, whether it can return the PRF bytes, and what that means for the reader. The ladder below the table is what the page offers when PRF is off.

| Where the passkey lives | Needs | Travels? | PRF | What the reader gets |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Password Manager** (Chrome signed in, Android) | A Google account | Yes, to every device signed in to it | Yes | The same newsroom everywhere |
| **iCloud Keychain** (Safari, iPhone, iPad, Mac) | An Apple ID | Yes, across Apple devices | Yes, Safari 18 and macOS 15 | The same newsroom on every Apple device |
| **Windows Hello** (Windows 11) | The device; a Microsoft account to sync | Device-bound, unless synced | Yes, since February 2026 | This PC, or every PC on the account |
| **A hardware key** (YubiKey and others) | The key, and its PIN | Yes, wherever the key is plugged in | Yes, through `hmac-secret`; not with YubiKeys in Safari | No account anywhere; a few dozen passkeys per key |
| **Your phone, by QR** (the hybrid flow) | A passkey on the phone, in its own store | Yes, one scan at a time | Where the phone's store does | A clean laptop opens with the phone beside it |
| **Chrome's own profile store** (a clean Chrome, no store signed in) | Nothing | No: this browser, on this computer | No, in 2026 tests | Signs, returns no bytes: the top cannot be derived |

So the rule, in one line: **the same newsroom on every device needs a synced store or a hardware key in your pocket.** A clean browser with neither gives you this device, plus the saved key. A passkey made there still works, as a passkey; it is stored by the device, tied to that browser profile on that computer, and deleted with it. The catch for this design is the last row: Chrome's own store, used when there is no provider (a clean Chrome on Linux, or on a Mac with iCloud Keychain off), signs but returns no PRF bytes in 2026 tests, so the top cannot be derived there at all.

Two things follow. The page learns which case it is in at creation, from `prf.enabled`, and never guesses. And when PRF is off, it offers a ladder, in this order: sign in to a store, so the passkey syncs from now on; use your phone by QR, one scan at a time; plug in a hardware key; or stay on this device, where the browser's own copy keeps working and the saved key is the way back. That is a real limitation of PRF today, not of the design, and the article would be dishonest without it. One caveat on the Chrome-profile row: it comes from a vendor's published tests, so the brief includes a five-minute check on a clean profile before anyone depends on it.

### The brief for the MVP

*For the session that runs newsroom.sgit.ai. Written by the sgit.ai site session for Dinis Cruz, 11 October 2026, and revised the same day. Dinis decides what ships, and is the first user.*

1. **Signed in where you already are.** The first screen is the passkey, and the page says in one line that the passkey lives in the store you already use and goes where it goes. No sign-in to the site, no OAuth, no email, in the MVP or in the plan.
2. **The passkey**: create with `rp.id = newsroom.sgit.ai`, a resident key, user verification required, `extensions.prf`, a user handle and display name chosen for the role; get with the fixed PRF input; check `prf.enabled`. When it is false, the ladder: sign in to a store, your phone by QR, a hardware key, or this device only, each explained in one line.
3. **The derivation** in part one, with test vectors shared with the sgit command line.
4. **The vaults**: the top, computed, and the reading vault below it, created with the access key, using the browser code that already reads and writes vaults, taken from the [vault web app](https://vault.sgraph.ai/) and [tools.sgraph.ai](https://tools.sgraph.ai/) and vendored into the reader repository. The top holds the reading vault's key, the access key and the key pairs; nothing else goes in it.
5. **The identity**: generate a signing pair and an encryption pair at random on first run, store them in the top with a label, a purpose, a date and a status, and publish the public halves where the share page and the subscribe lane need them. Never derive a key pair from the passkey.
6. **The move**: the reading account from the browser's storage into the reading vault, as the first device's log.
7. **The right-hand side**: once open, show the top: its entries by name and purpose, and the reading vault's contents, so the user can see what is kept and where, with a lock button, and the name of the passkey that opened it.
8. **Several passkeys**: a second passkey with its own handle and name computes its own top; a move screen that is a copy with a sentence about history; a retire screen that walks the order in part one, deletes the vault with `delete-on-remote`, and ends by sending the person to their store's settings to delete the passkey.
9. **Tests**: Chromium's virtual authenticator with PRF in the build (secrets.sgit.ai found it works in Chromium 141); the first run, a new device, a second passkey and a retirement, end to end; a clean Chrome profile with no store, to confirm what its own store returns for `prf.enabled` and that the ladder appears; two stores in one Chrome on a Mac, to confirm which return PRF bytes; two devices editing offline and agreeing; a [synthetic reader](../articles/how-to-run-synthetic-users.md) who has never heard of a vault key.
10. **Not in the MVP**: any sign-in to the site, a cloud backup, sharing across sites, anything on a server of ours.

The acceptance test is the experience in the second paragraph of this article: a new browser, a gesture, and my reading account, on my iPhone, my iPad, my laptops and my iMac.

## Part two: what this enables

Once these dots are connected, we have something we did not have before: an end-to-end path from a gesture to a vault, entirely in the browser, on commodity pieces. And just about every site and project we build needs exactly that.

- **Accounts with no server, and no identity.** A static site gets a user who can open their own data on any device, and keep it private from the site's operator. No account database, no password, no email, no back end.
- **Data the operator cannot read.** Not as a promise in a privacy policy, but as a property: the vault server holds ciphertext, and the keys are on the user's devices.
- **One top, many vaults.** The reading vault is the first. The same top can hold the key to [secrets.sgit.ai](https://secrets.sgit.ai/)'s keyring, a RiskMandate customer's policies, the memory of an agent the user runs, or the notes a reader sends to the newsroom.
- **Sharing without shared secrets.** The key pairs in the top are what [RFC 0001](../articles/rfc-0001-public-key-cryptography-for-sgit.md) needs: give someone a vault key by encrypting it to their public key, with no secret sent in a chat.
- **One account across sites.** Two ways, later. A key hub, such as secrets.sgit.ai, holds the top and hands a site only the key to its own vault, after the user approves it in a pop-up, the way a wallet connects to a site. Or, across different domains, WebAuthn's Related Origin Requests let one passkey work on a list of related sites, in Chrome and Safari today.
- **For anyone else.** None of this is specific to us. Any static site, on any host, could use a passkey with PRF and a vault, and give its users the same thing. I would like it to become a small, open component, the way [SG Meter](../articles/pay-after-you-read.md) is for reading.

If a site ever needs a stronger statement of who the user is, for a purchase that must be refunded to a person or a support case that must find them, a sign-in with Google or Apple can be added on an origin of its own, handing back an account id and nothing else. With no back end to hold that id, I am not sure we will ever need it, and the design does not depend on it.

This is why I think it matters more than a login feature. It is the moment the client-side pattern stops needing anyone's server for identity and storage, and becomes something other sites can use.

## What this does not claim

- **None of it is built yet.** The pieces exist (sgit, vaults, the vault web app, passkeys with PRF, the secrets.sgit.ai design and its passkey lab), and this is the design that joins them.
- **The support table is a snapshot.** It is from vendor documentation and published tests in 2026, and some of it, Firefox and Microsoft's own password manager in particular, is still moving. Which stores return PRF bytes inside which browser on a Mac is tested in the brief, not asserted here.
- **Computing the top is a choice with a cost.** A top is lost with its passkey; the saved key and a second passkey are what cover it.
- **What changed from the first version.** The door vault is gone: the computed vault is the top, and the master vault became its first child. Sign-in with Google is no longer a later phase of the design; it is a line at the end about something we may never need. The key pairs are stated to be random, not derived. Several passkeys, moves between tops and retiring a top are new, as is the role of sgit's delete.

If you build sites that need accounts without a back end, or you work on passkeys or password managers and want to try this with us, write to [agent@riskmandate.ai](mailto:agent@riskmandate.ai).

## Where this comes from

A voice memo of mine, recorded on 11 October 2026, asking for the design and for research into what a passkey gives a website and where an encrypted vault key could be kept, and a review conversation the same day that removed the door vault and the sign-in and added several passkeys; written by this site's agent in the voice of this site. The argument and the editorial responsibility are mine. The design builds on secrets.sgit.ai's published design ([how it works](https://secrets.sgit.ai/how-it-works/), [the keyring format](https://secrets.sgit.ai/keyring/), [passkeys, WebAuthn and PRF](https://secrets.sgit.ai/learn/passkeys/) and [keys](https://secrets.sgit.ai/learn/keys/)), and on how sgit generates and parses vault keys in the client (`generate_vault_key` and `parse_vault_key`), deletes a vault (`sgit vault delete-on-remote`) and rotates a key (`sgit rekey`), read from the sgit command line's source; the unlock cost was measured with WebCrypto PBKDF2 in headless Chromium on 11 October 2026. The research: Corbado, [Passkeys and WebAuthn PRF for end-to-end encryption (2026)](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkeys-prf-webauthn) and [WebAuthn L3 support in credential managers](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-l3-credential-manager-support); Yubico, [Developer's guide to PRF](https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/Concepts/PRF_Extension/Developers_Guide_to_PRF.html); Mozilla, [support for the WebAuthn PRF extension](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1863819); Chromium, [intent to ship the PRF extension](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/iTNOgLwD2bI); web.dev, [passkey reuse across sites with Related Origin Requests](https://web.dev/articles/webauthn-related-origin-requests).

- [No server, by design: first I retired the database, now I am retiring the back end](no-server-by-design.md) First the database went, now the back end: the SGit Newsroom runs all its logic in the browser, on commodity servers that cannot read your data.
- [RFC 0001: two ways to add public-key cryptography to sgit, and the questions we want you to answer](rfc-0001-public-key-cryptography-for-sgit.md) A Request for Comments: two key pairs so a reader cannot write, sealed files only named people can open, and fourteen questions for reviewers.
- [How to run synthetic users on your own site: five people who do not exist, a browser, and an afternoon](how-to-run-synthetic-users.md) Five invented users, a model reading screenshots, and a real browser: how to run synthetic users, from three studies.
- [Pay after you read: how a reading meter became a working business model in one afternoon, one release at a time](pay-after-you-read.md) Seven releases in one afternoon turned the reading meter into a working model: pay after you read, and the rating sets the price.
- [Where the vault keys live: key management at sgit-ai v0.20.0, and what comes next](where-the-vault-keys-live.md) Vault key management at sgit-ai v0.20.0: the one secret, where keys are kept, how they travel sealed on append lanes, and what comes next.

### Continued by

- [Go slow to go fast: moving the newsroom from an explorer project to a villager one, with the brief to do it](explorer-to-villager-newsroom.md) The newsroom is live and charging. Move the reader code to its own repo, same bytes and same bugs, then map, test, review and refactor before new features.
