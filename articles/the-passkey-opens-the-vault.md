# The passkey opens the vault: sign in with Google, touch a passkey, and a master vault for every user, with no server of ours, sgit.ai

# The passkey opens the vault: sign in with Google, touch a passkey, and a master vault for every user, with no server of ours

By [Dinis Cruz](../about/index.md) · 2026-10-11 · [article v1.0.0](versions/the-passkey-opens-the-vault.md) · [site v0.7.55](../admin/versions.md) · passkeyswebauthnprfvaultskey-managementgoogle-sign-inclient-sidenewsroomarchitecturebriefsecretsarticle

***Abstract:** The missing piece of the client-side puzzle is a user who can open their own vaults on any device, in a few seconds, with nothing to remember. This is the design. Sign in with Google says who you are. A passkey, through the WebAuthn PRF extension, gives the browser 32 bytes that only your authenticator can produce for this site, and from those bytes the browser computes the key of a small door vault, which holds the key of your master vault, which holds the keys of everything else, starting with your newsroom vault. The question I could not answer, where the encrypted vault key is stored, has a simple answer: nowhere. sgit vault keys are made in the client, so the door's key and its id can be computed from the passkey on any device, before anything is fetched, and there is no chicken and egg. A recovery code makes a second door to the same master. Google holds no key; its Drive app-data folder can keep a backup. PRF is now supported by Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain, Windows Hello and Firefox. The first part is the technical design and the brief for the MVP on newsroom.sgit.ai, end to end; the second is what it enables: accounts with no server, for this site and for any other.*

The key chain. Sign in with Google says who you are. The passkey's PRF output derives a door vault, the door holds the master vault's key, and the master holds the keys of everything else. Nothing secret is stored anywhere to be fetched, and the vault server sees ciphertext at every step.

This is the missing piece of the puzzle. In [I miss it, so it is working](../articles/i-miss-it.md) I described the feature I miss: the newsroom on every device, in sync, through my own encrypted vault. In [No server, by design](../articles/no-server-by-design.md) I listed identity as one of the last things that still seemed to need a server. This article joins the two, in detail.

The experience I want is simple. I open newsroom.sgit.ai in a new browser. I sign in with Google. I am asked to touch my passkey. And my reading account opens, the same as on every other device, because it is now in a vault only I can open. Three steps, one of them a gesture, and no server of ours anywhere.

I had one question I could not answer: where is the vault key kept? The short answer, after the research, is that it is not kept anywhere. It is computed. The rest of this article is why that works, the design end to end, and what it makes possible for every other site we run.

## In short

- **Sign in with Google says who you are; it does not open anything.** It gives the browser a stable account id, with no server of ours, and ties what you bought to you. It never holds a key.
- **The passkey is what opens the vault.** With the WebAuthn PRF extension, a passkey returns 32 bytes that only your authenticator can produce, for this site, and the same bytes on every device the passkey syncs to.
- **Where is the vault key stored? Nowhere.** sgit vault keys are made in the client, a passphrase and a vault id. So the browser computes a door vault's key and id from the PRF bytes, opens it, and finds the master vault's key inside. No chicken and egg, no new storage, only vault APIs.
- **One master vault per user.** It holds the keys of your other vaults (the newsroom vault first), your access key, your key pair and the list of your doors.
- **Every passkey is a door, and so is a recovery code.** An iPhone and a Windows laptop with different passkeys get two doors to the same master. A 128-bit recovery code, shown once, is a third. Lose them all and no one, including us, can open it.
- **Support is good enough to build on.** PRF works in Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain (Safari 18 and macOS 15), Windows Hello (since February 2026) and Firefox. Where it does not, the page says so and offers the recovery code.
- **One rule the design depends on:** the page that holds the keys loads no third-party scripts, Google's included. Sign-in happens on its own page.
- **It is not just for the newsroom.** Every site we build needs the same thing: an account with no server, data nobody else can read, on every device. This is that, as a pattern.

## Part one: the design

### What each piece actually gives you

It helps to separate the pieces, because they are easy to blur.

| Piece | What it gives the page | What it does not give |
|---|---|---|
| **Sign in with Google** | An ID token with a stable account id and an email, in the browser, through Google Identity Services; optionally an access token for one narrow Drive scope | Any key. Google sign-in alone opens nothing |
| **A passkey for this site** | A gesture (touch, face, PIN), a signature, and with PRF, 32 bytes computed from a secret the authenticator keeps for this site and this passkey | The bytes to anyone but the page on this site that asked, after the gesture |
| **The passkey provider** | Sync: Google Password Manager across your Chrome and Android devices, iCloud Keychain across your Apple devices, or none (a hardware key) | Anything about what the bytes are for |
| **sgit** | Vault keys made in the client (a 24-character passphrase and an 8-character vault id), read and write keys derived from them, ciphertext on the server | A way to find a vault you have no key for |
| **The access key** | The right to create vaults and write to them on the vault server, the thing people will buy | Any way to read a vault |

One clarification that matters. When I say "the Google passkey", what the page uses is a passkey **for this site**, registered by this page under this site's name, which your provider stores and syncs. If you use Chrome, that provider is Google Password Manager. It is not the passkey you use to sign in to Google itself, and a website cannot get PRF bytes from that one. Sign in with Google and the passkey are two separate steps, for two separate jobs: who you are, and what you can open.

### Where the vault key lives: nowhere

The places the key could live, and how you would find each before you could open it. Deriving the door from the passkey needs nothing to be found; the stored options become backups.

Every option for storing an encrypted vault key has the same problem: you have to find the encrypted key before you can open it, so it has to live somewhere you can reach with only what you have at that moment, which is your Google sign-in and your passkey.

- **Inside the vault itself:** you need the key to read the vault. The chicken and the egg.
- **An SG/Send transfer:** if the transfer id is assigned on upload, you need to have stored the id somewhere first.
- **Google Drive's app-data folder:** this is the "application data" I had in mind. It is a private, hidden folder per app in the user's own Drive, reached with the `drive.appdata` scope, which Google lists as recommended and non-sensitive. It works from the browser, with the user present for each token. A good place for a **backup**, but it makes Google part of every unlock.
- **A bucket keyed by the account id:** the design [secrets.sgit.ai](https://secrets.sgit.ai/) has, with Identity Platform and Cloud Storage. It works, and it is a cloud project per environment.
- **Inside the passkey (`largeBlob`):** support is too uneven to depend on.

And then the option that needs none of it. **sgit vault keys are generated in the client**: a random passphrase and a random vault id, and `sgit init` accepts a key it is given. So instead of generating a door vault's key at random and storing it, the browser **computes** it from the PRF bytes: the passphrase, and the vault id, with HKDF. On any device where the passkey is available, the same gesture gives the same bytes, the same door id and the same door key. The browser knows where to look and how to open it before it has fetched anything. The door holds one thing, the master vault's key, which is random and made once. The master holds everything else.

So the answer to my question: the vault key is not stored, it is derived; the master key is stored, inside a vault that only the passkey can find; and Google's app-data folder can keep a backup copy, encrypted, for the day something goes wrong.

### The derivation

For the newsroom MVP, with the relying party ID `newsroom.sgit.ai`:

1. **The PRF input** is a fixed, public value: `SHA-256("newsroom.sgit.ai/door/v1")`. An input is not a secret; only the authenticator can turn it into the 32 bytes.
2. **The door seed** is `HKDF-SHA256(ikm = PRF bytes, salt = SHA-256("newsroom.sgit.ai"), info = "sgit/door/v1")`.
3. **The door's passphrase and vault id** are two more HKDF outputs from the seed (`info = ".../passphrase"` and `".../id"`), mapped to sgit's alphabet of lowercase letters and digits with rejection sampling so no character is favoured: 24 characters and 8.
4. **The door vault key** is the sgit vault key made of those two, and from there, sgit's own derivation gives the read and write keys, exactly as the command line does.
5. **The recovery door** is the same, with the recovery code in place of the PRF bytes: 26 characters of base32, 128 bits, made by the page and shown once. It is long so that it needs no password stretching, as in the secrets.sgit.ai keyring design.
6. **Collisions** are not a practical worry with 36⁸ possible ids, but the page checks: a derived id that already holds something it cannot open is skipped, with a counter in the HKDF info.

The browser and the command line must agree byte for byte, so the brief includes test vectors: the same inputs through the browser code and through sgit in Python, with the same keys out.

### What is in each vault

- **A door vault:** one file, the master vault's key, and what kind of door it is (which passkey, or the recovery code).
- **The master vault:** the keys of your other vaults, by site; your access key; your key pair (the public key in the clear, the private key as a JWK); the list of your doors, so a lost passkey's door can be retired; and your Google account id, so the page can tell you if you have signed in as someone else.
- **The newsroom vault:** one log per device, appended, never edited: pages read and how far, ratings, personas, the reading list, notes, receipts by payment reference. Every device computes the same state from all the logs, as described in [I miss it](../articles/i-miss-it.md).

### The flows

The first run, a new device, and adding a passkey or recovering. Every step runs in the browser, against Google for sign-in, the user's passkey provider for the gesture, and the vault server for ciphertext.

**First run.** Sign in with Google. Create a passkey for the site with `prf` enabled; if the authenticator cannot do PRF, the page says which kinds can and offers another. Touch it: the PRF bytes give the door. Generate the master key, the newsroom vault key, a key pair and a recovery code. Paste the access key. Create the door, the master, the newsroom vault and the recovery door. Move the reading account from the browser's storage into the newsroom vault. Show the recovery code once, behind "I have written it down".

**A new device.** Sign in with Google. Touch the passkey, synced to this device or used from a phone by QR. The PRF bytes give the same door, the door gives the master, the master gives the newsroom vault. Reading needs no access key; the access key comes out of the master, so this device can write as well. Merge this browser's reading into its own log.

**A second provider.** An iPhone with iCloud Keychain and a Windows laptop with Windows Hello have different passkeys. While unlocked on one, register the other: its PRF bytes make a second door to the same master.

**Lost a passkey.** Type the recovery code; it derives the recovery door; register a new passkey; retire the old door in the master's list.

**Signing out and locking.** Keys exist only in the page's memory: cleared on sign-out, after a period of inactivity, and when the page is closed. The browser's own copy of the reading account stays as it is today.

### Security, said plainly

- **What each party sees.** The vault server: ciphertext, sizes, times and ids that look random. Google: that you signed in. Your passkey provider: that a credential exists for this site. Only this page, in your browser, after your gesture, holds the PRF bytes and the keys.
- **The page that holds the keys loads no third-party scripts.** That includes Google's sign-in library: sign-in runs on its own page, which passes only the account id onwards, and the page that unlocks loads nothing it did not build.
- **The relying party ID is a trust boundary.** A passkey for `sgit.ai` would work on every `*.sgit.ai` site, and any of those sites could ask it for PRF bytes, so every one of them would have to be as strict as the strictest. The MVP uses `newsroom.sgit.ai` exactly, as secrets.sgit.ai uses its own host. Sharing across sites is part two.
- **Passkeys cannot be phished across sites.** They are bound to the site's name; a look-alike domain gets nothing.
- **Losing everything is final.** Every passkey and the recovery code gone means no one can open the vaults. That is the property that makes the design worth having, and the first run says so before it shows the code.
- **Availability is not secrecy.** The vault server could delete or roll back ciphertext. It cannot read it. The local copy and the Drive backup cover the first; nothing is needed for the second.
- **Agents do not have passkeys.** An agent that should read part of a user's data gets a read key for one vault, given by the user from the master, never the master itself.

### Where PRF works today

As of October 2026, from vendor documentation and published tests (see the sources):

| Passkey provider | PRF |
|---|---|
| Google Password Manager (Chrome, Edge and Samsung Internet; Android) | Yes, by default; desktop Chrome from version 136 |
| iCloud Keychain (Safari 18, macOS 15) | Yes |
| Windows Hello | Yes, since the February 2026 update to Windows 11 |
| Firefox | Yes, on macOS from version 139 and Windows from version 148 |
| Hardware security keys | Yes through `hmac-secret`, but not with YubiKeys in Safari |
| Chrome's own profile authenticator | No |

The page checks `prf.enabled` when it creates the passkey, and never guesses: if it is false, it says so and offers another authenticator or the recovery code.

### The brief for the MVP

*For the session that runs newsroom.sgit.ai. Written by the sgit.ai site session for Dinis Cruz, 11 October 2026. Dinis decides what ships, and is the first user.*

1. **Sign in with Google**, on its own page, with Google Identity Services in the browser. Keep only the account id and email, for this session.
2. **The passkey**: create with `rp.id = newsroom.sgit.ai`, a resident key, user verification required, `extensions.prf`; get with the fixed PRF input; check `prf.enabled`.
3. **The derivation** in part one, with test vectors shared with the sgit command line.
4. **The vaults**: door, master, newsroom and recovery door, created with the access key, using the browser code that already reads and writes vaults (the [vault web app](https://vault.sgraph.ai/) and [tools.sgraph.ai](https://tools.sgraph.ai/)).
5. **The move**: the reading account from the browser's storage into the newsroom vault, as the first device's log.
6. **The right-hand side**: once open, show the vault: the master's list of vaults and doors, and the newsroom vault's contents, so the user can see what is kept and where.
7. **Tests**: Chromium's virtual authenticator with PRF in the build (secrets.sgit.ai found it works in Chromium 141); the first run, a new device and the recovery code, end to end; two devices editing offline and agreeing; a [synthetic reader](../articles/how-to-run-synthetic-users.md) who has never heard of a vault key.
8. **Not in the MVP**: the Drive backup, sharing across sites, anything on a server of ours.

The acceptance test is the experience in the second paragraph of this article: a new browser, Google, a gesture, and my reading account, on my iPhone, my iPad, my laptops and my iMac.

## Part two: what this enables

Once these dots are connected, we have something we did not have before: an end-to-end path from a login with a second factor to a vault, entirely in the browser, on commodity pieces. And just about every site and project we build needs exactly that.

- **Accounts with no server.** A static site gets a user who can sign in, open their own data on any device, and keep it private from the site's operator. No account database, no password, no back end.
- **Data the operator cannot read.** Not as a promise in a privacy policy, but as a property: the vault server holds ciphertext, and the keys are on the user's devices.
- **One master, many vaults.** The newsroom vault is the first. The same master can hold the key to [secrets.sgit.ai](https://secrets.sgit.ai/)'s keyring, a RiskMandate customer's policies, the memory of an agent the user runs, or the notes a reader sends to the newsroom.
- **Sharing without shared secrets.** The key pair in the master is what [RFC 0001](../articles/rfc-0001-public-key-cryptography-for-sgit.md) needs: give someone a vault key by encrypting it to their public key, with no secret sent in a chat.
- **One account across sites.** Two ways, later. A key hub, such as secrets.sgit.ai, holds the master and hands a site only the key to its own vault, after the user approves it in a pop-up, the way a wallet connects to a site. Or, across different domains, WebAuthn's Related Origin Requests let one passkey work on a list of related sites, in Chrome and Safari today.
- **For anyone else.** None of this is specific to us. Any static site, on any host, could use Google sign-in, a passkey with PRF and a vault, and give its users the same thing. I would like it to become a small, open component, the way [SG Meter](../articles/pay-after-you-read.md) is for reading.

This is why I think it matters more than a login feature. It is the moment the client-side pattern stops needing anyone's server for identity and storage, and becomes something other sites can use.

## What this does not claim

- **None of it is built yet.** The pieces exist (sgit, vaults, the vault web app, passkeys with PRF, the secrets.sgit.ai design and its passkey lab), and this is the design that joins them.
- **The support table is a snapshot.** It is from vendor documentation and published tests in 2026, and some of it, Firefox and Microsoft's own password manager in particular, is still moving.
- **Deriving the door is a choice with a cost.** A door is lost with its passkey; the recovery code and a second passkey are what cover it.

If you build sites that need accounts without a back end, or you work on passkeys or password managers and want to try this with us, write to [agent@riskmandate.ai](mailto:agent@riskmandate.ai).

## Where this comes from

A voice memo of mine, recorded on 11 October 2026, asking for the design and for research into what a passkey gives a website and where an encrypted vault key could be kept; written by this site's agent in the voice of this site. The argument and the editorial responsibility are mine. The design builds on secrets.sgit.ai's published design ([how it works](https://secrets.sgit.ai/how-it-works/), [the keyring format](https://secrets.sgit.ai/keyring/), [passkeys, WebAuthn and PRF](https://secrets.sgit.ai/learn/passkeys/) and [keys](https://secrets.sgit.ai/learn/keys/)), and on how sgit generates vault keys in the client (`generate_vault_key` in the sgit command line). The research: Corbado, [Passkeys and WebAuthn PRF for end-to-end encryption (2026)](https://www.corbado.com/blog/passkeys-prf-webauthn) and [WebAuthn L3 support in credential managers](https://www.corbado.com/blog/webauthn-l3-credential-manager-support); Yubico, [Developer's guide to PRF](https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/Concepts/PRF_Extension/Developers_Guide_to_PRF.html); Mozilla, [support for the WebAuthn PRF extension](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1863819); Chromium, [intent to ship the PRF extension](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/iTNOgLwD2bI); web.dev, [passkey reuse across sites with Related Origin Requests](https://web.dev/articles/webauthn-related-origin-requests); Google, [choosing Google Drive API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) and [authorising for the web](https://developers.google.com/identity/oauth2/web/guides/overview).
